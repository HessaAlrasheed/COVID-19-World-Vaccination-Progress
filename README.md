# COVID-19 World Vaccination Progress
This is project made for the Online Data Science Bootcamps for SDAIA Academy.

# Abstract
The goal of this project is to use time series analysis forecasting method which is AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to predict tht total
number of vaccination for the next month in Saudi Arabia country. And do some manipulation.

# Dataset
The dataset tracks the total number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in each country, broken down by first and second doses (where national data is available), and derived daily vaccination rates and population-adjusted figures. The dataset include 61613 records and 15 features. You can find the date

# Tools
- numpy and pandas for data manipulation.
- ARIMA for modeling.
- matplotlib and seaborn for plotting.
- The work will be done through colab notebook.
